# lapper

This is a Crystal port of Brent Pendersen's [nim-lapper](https://github.com/brentp/nim-lapper). This crate works well for most genomic interval data. It does have a notable worst case scenario when very long regions engulf large percentages of the other intervals. As usual, you should benchmark on your expected data and see how it works.
